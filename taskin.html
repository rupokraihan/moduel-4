    <h1>Taskin Ahmed</h1>
    <h4>Bangladesh</h4>

    <p>
        Even before he was anywhere near making his international debut, Taskin Ahmed became an internet sensation. A video of his spell against England Under-19s in 2012 found its way to Youtube, and the sight of a Bangladeshi fast bowler ripping it past batsman and hitting the wicketkeeper's gloves quite hard and high made people curious

<h3>Profile</h3>



<p>Taskin Ahmed Tazim is a Bangladeshi cricketer. He is a right-arm fast bowler and a left-handed batsman. He represents Dhaka Metropolis in first-class and List A cricket and the Rangpur Rangers franchise in the Bangladesh Premier League. Taskin Ahmed is the first Bangladeshi cricketer to take 5 wicket in ODI debut.</p>

<p>Tskin is a tall fast bowler, with a body structure slightly akin to Mashrafe Mortaza. He bowls with a high-arm action, after coming in from a smooth run-up. He is a product of Dhaka's cricket academy scene, having learned his craft at the Abahani ground nets, living nearby in Mohammadpur.</p>

    <p>He burst into the domestic scene with a four-wicket haul in the 2013 BPL, but he suffered a knee injury soon after which kept him sidelined for nearly a year. He went through rehabilitation work during the time, and as he slowly recovered, Taskin bowled in the Bangladesh nets regularly.</p>
    
    <p>The coaching staff was impressed by his ability, and kept him in the radar for a very long time, until they found the right time to blood him. Taskin made his T20 debut for Bangladesh in the World T20, and has been retained in the ODI squad for the India series in June 2014.
