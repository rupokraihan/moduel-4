<h3>Profile</h3>

<p>Born in Dinanjpur, Liton Das is a Bangladeshi opening batsman and wicket-keeper, who was a part of the 2012 and 2014 Under-19 World Cup team and shone in both the editions with the bat and had been touted as the next big thing in Bangladesh cricket.</p>

<p>He made his first-class debut in October 2011 for Rangpur Division against Dhaka Division. He didn't have a great first season, but fought back strongly in the following season registering a ton and a half-century. His career was boosted after his performances in the 2014 U-19 World Cup held in Abu Dhabi, where he scored 239 runs in just four innings.</p>

<p>Post the heroics in the Under-19 tournament, Liton developed into a better player and that was evident in his domestic outings. He ended up as the second highest run-getter in the Dhaka Premier League and then amplified the performances in the longer format. From second best in List A, Liton went onto top the run-charts in the National Cricket League playing for Rangpur Division. He struck five centuries and aggregated more than 1000 runs finishing the season with a mind-boggling average of 85.33.</p>

<p>Das made his Test debut against India in June 2015. He played some eye-pleasing strokes before he fell for 44 off 45 balls. He bettered his performance against the then ranked one team, South Africa, and registered his maiden Test fifty. He hasn't showcased his talents in the shorter formats and that has resulted in an in-and-out selection in the national team. He faces a stiff competition with Nurul Hasan to don the gloves whenever Mushfiqur Rahim misses an international game.</p>
